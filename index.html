        <h1> Welcome! </h1>

        <p> I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at Columbia University. My research focuses on political behavior in the United States as citizens confront risks to democracy. 
  I explore whether and how Americans respond to the extraordinary circumstances of contemporary politics by engaging in unusual political behaviors. 
          My research uses survey and field experiments and my methodological interests lie in experimental and survey methods. </p>
          
          <p> In the past, I have conducted research on Congressional town halls and the historical roots of foreign aid provision. 
         In my spare time I can be found playing racket sports with vastly varying degrees of skill. </p>

        <p> My research is or has been supported by the Center for Effective Lawmaking, the Columbia Experimental Laboratory for the Social Sciences, 
          the Institute for Humane Studies, the Stanford Polarization and Social Change Lab and the Civic Health and Institutions Project.
          I am grateful also to the activist and political groups with whom I have cooperated on field experiments. </p>

    Can fear of the opposing partyâ€™s retaliation deter support for anti-democratic behavior? In contemporary American politics, partisans express fear that their opponents will violate democratic norms. In theory, this type of belief can reinforce support for democracy, if voters subscribe to a logic of deterrence and believe that opponents violate democratic norms if and only if they are first provoked. I study these beliefs in the American public and distinguish them theoretically and empirically from other contributors to preferences over democratic norms. In a pair of prediction experiments (n = 7,000; 26,000 predictions), I show that partisans predict retaliation from opponents but only of modest scale: an average of less than 10\% increase in the probability of a norm violation compared to their baseline predictions in the absence of provocation. These predictions are smaller than equivalent beliefs from a sample of political elites and are far from theoretical maxima. In a set of follow-up experiments, I randomize exposure to an explicit warning of retaliation across 5 different proposals to distort rules in favor of the respondent's party across three experimental samples (n = 5,500). These warnings modestly but consistently reduce support for these proposals. I argue that this style of reasoning has the potential to promote pro-democratic attitudes even when voters have inconsistent commitments to democracy and elites are unwilling to promote high-minded arguments for democratic norms.

      Will voters participate in the primary of a party they oppose to prevent the nomination of a candidate they fear? 
      Partnering with a Political Action Committee, we conduct a first-of-its-kind, large, preregistered field experiment (N = 83,800)
      in the lead-up to the 2024 Republican presidential primary in New Hampshire. A specialized get-out-the-vote intervention increases turnout 
      in the Republican primary among undeclared voters who are modeled as likely to vote for Democratic candidates in the general election.
      Our treatment increased Republican primary turnout in this sample by 1.6 percentage points while reducing turnout in the Democratic Primary by 0.5 
      percentage points. Supplementing our experiment with surveys before and after the primary, we estimate that each vote cast by Democratic-leaning voters in the Republican primary had between a 78% and 95% probability of supporting the relatively moderate Republican primary candidate. We argue that voters are capable of sophisticated, risk-mitigating behavior in primaries.

     Correcting false and negative beliefs about political opponents has shown promise in reducing anti-democratic attitudes and polarization. Despite the simple nature of such corrections, there is little extant evidence that they are effective beyond immediately administered survey outcomes and it is unclear which voters opt-in to such interventions. To test these mechanisms, we worked with a partner organizations to implement a depolarization initiative that bundled factual belief corrections with elites modeling civil disagreement. We recruited an online panel of 3,461 eligible respondents and then randomized an offer to attend a 30 minute depolarization event in which bipartisan elites defended democratic values and discussed polling information suggesting mass commitment to democracy across party lines. We report two main sets of findings. First, despite generous financial incentives, there was substantial differential compliance by partisanship, though not by pre-treatment attitudinal measures of affective polarization or anti-democratic attitudes. Second, our intervention achieved a durable reduction in beliefs that opponents were opposed to democracy (measured at 1 week and 2 months post-event) and in willingness to attend future depolarization events. However, we found no reduction in anti-democratic attitudes across many pre-registered outcomes. We use a follow-up survey experiment to explore the mechanisms underlying both of these findings.

Scholars express widespread concern about the pressure primary elections place on candidates to adopt ideologically extreme positions. Yet, in at least 17 open primary states, swathes of ideologically diverse voters are eligible to participate in primaries of parties with which they do not identify. This behavior remains rare, even as many elections are only competitive in the primary, leaving voters not of the dominant party without a say in the decisive electoral contest. Why? We propose three explanations. First, voters believe that participating in opposing party primaries goes against their affective partisan instincts and their understanding of democratic norms. Second, the set of candidates running in primaries may not be sufficiently appealing to opposing partisans to motivate crossover voting. Third, campaigns may not make efforts to encourage crossover voting. Across four preregistered survey and field experiments, we find support for all three mechanisms and show that it is feasible to encourage crossover voting in both survey experimental and real-world contexts - and that circumstances of elections dramatically affect voter propensity to crossover. We argue that this hitherto unusual form of voter behavior is necessary for institutional reforms that seek to reduce the polarizing pressure of partisan primaries to realize their goals, and is a key path for voters opposed to the majority party in single-party districts to make their vote count.
