      <h1> Welcome!</h1>

      <p> I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at Columbia University. </p>

      <p> <strong> I am on the 2025-26 academic job market. </strong> </p>

      <p> My research focuses on how strategic considerations shape the reactions of American voters and parties to the
        risk of democratic
        backsliding. I have related agendas on crossover voting (when voters participate in the primary of the
        opposing party), depolarization initiatives and how norms shape intra-party competition. Broadly, I am
        interested in areas where threats from opponents inspire unusual or complex behaviors in the American public.
        Methodologically, I use survey and field experiments, as well as elite interviews and descriptive data. </p>
      </p>


      <p> My research is or has been supported by the Center for Effective Lawmaking, the Columbia Experimental
        Laboratory for the Social Sciences, the Columbia Center for Political Economy,
        the Institute for Humane Studies, the Stanford Polarization and Social Change Lab and the Civic Health and

                Can fear of the opposing party’s retaliation deter support for anti-democratic behavior? In contemporary
                American politics, partisans express fear that their opponents will violate democratic norms. In theory,
                this type of belief can reinforce support for democracy, if voters subscribe to a logic of deterrence
                and believe that opponents violate democratic norms if and only if they are first provoked. I study
                these beliefs in the American public and distinguish them theoretically and empirically from other
                contributors to preferences over democratic norms. In a pair of prediction experiments (n = 7,000;
                26,000 predictions), I show that partisans predict retaliation from opponents but only of modest scale:
                an average of less than 10% increase in the probability of a norm violation compared to their baseline
                predictions in the absence of provocation. These predictions are smaller than equivalent beliefs from a
                sample of political elites and are far from theoretical maxima. In a set of follow-up experiments, I
                randomize exposure to an explicit warning of retaliation across 5 different proposals to distort rules
                in favor of the respondent's party across three experimental samples (n = 5,500). These warnings
                modestly but consistently reduce support for these proposals. I argue that this style of reasoning has
                the potential to promote pro-democratic attitudes even when voters have inconsistent commitments to
                democracy and elites are unwilling to promote high-minded arguments for democratic norms.

              Will voters participate in the primary of a party they oppose to prevent the nomination of a candidate
              they fear?
              Partnering with a Political Action Committee, we conduct a first-of-its-kind, large, preregistered field
              experiment (N = 83,800)
              in the lead-up to the 2024 Republican presidential primary in New Hampshire. A specialized
              get-out-the-vote intervention increases turnout
              in the Republican primary among undeclared voters who are modeled as likely to vote for Democratic
              candidates in the general election.
              Our treatment increased Republican primary turnout in this sample by 1.6 percentage points while reducing
              turnout in the Democratic Primary by 0.5
              percentage points. Supplementing our experiment with surveys before and after the primary, we estimate
              that each vote cast by Democratic-leaning voters in the Republican primary had between a 78% and 95%
              probability of supporting the relatively moderate Republican primary candidate. We argue that voters are
              capable of sophisticated, risk-mitigating behavior in primaries.

                What do Americans predict as the material consequences of violating democratic rules? Recent
                scholarship has established that Americans broadly oppose anti-democratic behavior, but are unwilling to
                sacrifice partisan objectives in order to defend democracy. Despite a burgeoning agenda on citizen
                attitudes towards democracy, we know little about whether the mass views anti-democratic behavior as
                effective at either shifting electoral outcomes or achieving otherwise impossible policy objectives.
                Using an incentivized prediction experiment fielded in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, I
                explore these beliefs. I show that Americans' beliefs are partially consistent with standard academic
                accounts. First, respondents believe that anti-democratic behavior shifts election results, with the
                pooled effect across all respondents being roughly equivalent to the predicted effect of a large
                spending advantage for one candidate. Second, when considering Republican violations of democratic rules
                and norms, Democrats believe those violations are far more effective than Republican beliefs about the
                same behaviors. These results are normatively comforting, voters do not believe their side's violations
                of democratic rules are especially effective. Voters do not, however, distinguish between the
                effectiveness of changes to electoral rules and of threats directed at elected officials, despite the
                divergence in the plausible electoral impact of these behaviors. </p>

                Do voters engage in anticipatory balancing by supporting limited congressional power for the
                party they expect to win the presidency? We provide a causal test of existing descriptive accounts by
                using a repeated-measures experiment (N = 2900), which incorporates three embedded randomizations to
                test multiple mechanisms of anticipatory balancing. By priming (i) each candidate’s odds of winning the
                2024 presidential election, (ii) the probability of extreme policy outcomes, and (iii) hypothetical
                election outcomes, we examine a range of mechanisms through which anticipatory balancing may occur. We
                find evidence only in the most extreme case: subjects engage in modest balancing (A 4 percentage point
                shift in preferences for congressional control and net vote share) in response to hypothetical accounts
                of certain victory by one candidate, with effects driven by sophisticated voters. Our results suggest
                anticipatory balancing is possible, but is limited in both magnitude and the contexts in which it can
                realistically occur.

              Americans increasingly report censoring their political beliefs for fear of social repercussions—not from
              adversaries, but from co-partisans. We assess if the conventional theory that social pressure stifles
              minority opinions extends to this lesser-studied context. Using a nationwide survey experiment fielded
              during the 2024 primaries (N = 17,691), we show that intra-party speech is more costly to dissenters than
              the party faithful. Social pressure, however, constrains both. We document widespread misperceptions about
              the likelihood of social sanctions, then randomly correct these exaggerated fears to manipulate social
              pressure's salience. This intervention reduces self-censorship for party minorities and majorities alike,
              suggesting that intra-party social pressure results less from injunctive norms dictating what
              right-thinking partisans should say than from a widely shared aversion to divisive debate. To explain
              dissenters' disproportionate self-censorship, we look beyond assumptions about differential exposure to
              social pressure and highlight other important motivations—namely, majorities' unusual eagerness to
              persuade co-partisan opponents.

              Why do anti-democratic candidates thrive in American politics, despite public opposition to most
              anti-democratic behavior? We offer a pair of explanations. First, promoting the violation of democratic
              rules serves as a signal of ideological commitment, such that voters infer. This mechanism allows for
              voters who view democratic values as mechanically orthogonal to policy, but who have beliefs about the
              distribution of positions in the population. Second, it is possible that such violations are signals of
              credibility about policies that can only be accomplished through transgressing norms.

              Correcting false and negative beliefs about political opponents has shown promise in reducing
              anti-democratic attitudes and polarization. Despite the simple nature of such corrections, there is little
              extant evidence that they are effective beyond immediately administered survey outcomes and it is unclear
              which voters opt-in to such interventions. To test these mechanisms, we worked with a partner
              organization to implement a depolarization initiative that bundled factual belief corrections with elites
              modeling civil disagreement. We recruited an online panel of 3,461 eligible respondents and then
              randomized an offer to attend a 30 minute depolarization event in which bipartisan elites defended
              democratic values and discussed polling information suggesting a broad commitment to democracy across
              party
              lines. We report two main sets of findings. First, despite generous financial incentives, there was
              substantial differential compliance by partisanship, though not by pre-treatment attitudinal measures of
              affective polarization or anti-democratic attitudes. Second, our intervention achieved a durable reduction
              in beliefs that opponents were opposed to democracy (measured at 1 week and 2 months post-event) and in
              willingness to attend future depolarization events. However, we found no reduction in anti-democratic
              attitudes across many pre-registered outcomes. We use a follow-up survey experiment to explore the
              mechanisms underlying both of these findings.

                Scholars express widespread concern about the pressure primary elections place on candidates to adopt
                ideologically extreme positions. Yet, in at least 17 open primary states, swathes of ideologically
                diverse voters are eligible to participate in primaries of parties with which they do not identify. This
                behavior remains rare, even as many elections are only competitive in the primary, leaving voters not of
                the
                dominant party without a say in the decisive electoral contest. Why? We propose three explanations.
                First,
                voters believe that participating in opposing party primaries goes against their affective partisan
                instincts and their understanding of democratic norms. Second, the set of candidates running in
                primaries
                may not be sufficiently appealing to opposing partisans to motivate crossover voting. Third, campaigns
                may
                not make efforts to encourage crossover voting. Across four preregistered survey and field experiments,
                we
                find support for all three mechanisms and show that it is feasible to encourage crossover voting in both
                survey experimental and real-world contexts - and that circumstances of elections dramatically affect
                voter propensity to crossover. We argue that this often dismissed form of voter behavior is necessary
                for
                institutional reforms that seek to reduce the polarizing pressure of partisan primaries to realize their
                goals, and is a key path for voters opposed to the majority party in single-party districts to make
                their
                vote count.

              America's parties have ceded formal control over presidential nominating contests to voters. But party
              elites retain substantial indirect control through endorsements and donations and wield direct control in
              usual circumstances like candidate withdrawals or contested conventions. At the same time, rising populist
              sentiment within each party has led to widespread public anger at elite involvement in primaries - and
              repeated allegations of improper efforts to influence nominations. In this paper, we explore what voters
              and elites believe is appropriate regarding the involvement of various party actors in the selection of
              nominees. We investigate these phenomena both in general and in unique circumstances surrounding Joe
              Biden's withdrawal in the 2024 nominating contest. We find that American voters express a deep skepticism
              of elite involvement in the nominating process. Even in the unusual case of Biden's withdrawal from the
              race, Democrats prefer that delegates selected the nominee who is favored by the majority of their
              co-partisans. We examine both sides of this question: party elites' beliefs about the appropriateness of
              involvement, and voter reactions to such involvement in both realistic and hypothetical scenarios.

                What is the effect of an intervention where treatment can be accidentally served to individuals whose
                outcomes and compliance are not observed? I consider a setting where treatment is assigned to an
                experimental universe with visible compliance and outcomes, but that universe is part of a broader
                population of interest whose outcomes and treatment status are not observed. I consider how the
                unintentional, and often un-observed, re-allocation of "missed" treatment from non-compliers in the
                treatment group to the rest of the universe affects estimation. To explore this mechanism requires two
                calculations, which reflect facts on the ground that can rarely be directly observed by experimenters.
                First, the accidental targeting creates a set of always-takers whose proportion is dependent on the
                geographic density of the experimental universe relative to the population. Second, the same
                re-allocation
                creates a treatment effect among accidentally targeted individuals in the population who are not in the
                intended experimental universe altogether. Depending on assumptions about treatment effect heterogeneity
                and the relative weights an implementing organization places on persuading individuals not in the target
