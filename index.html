        <h1> Welcome! </h1>

        <p> I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at Columbia University. My research focuses on political behavior in the United States as citizens confront the prospect of democratic backsliding. 
  I explore whether and how Americans respond to the extraordinary circumstances of contemporary politics by engaging in unusual political behaviors. 
          My research uses survey and field experiments and my methodological interests lie in experimental and survey methods. </p>
          
          <p> In the past, I have done research on Congressional Behavior and the historical roots of foreign aid provision. 
         In my spare time I can be found wandering Morningside Heights and playing racket sports with vastly varying degrees of skill. </p>

        <p> My research is or has been supported by the Center for Effective Lawmaking, the Columbia Experimental Labratory for the Social Sciences, 
          the Institute for Humane Studies, the Stanford Polarization and Social Change Lab and the Civic Health and Institutions Project.
          I am indebted also to the activist and political groups with whom I have cooperated on field experimental investigations of political behavior. </p>

        <p>  <b> I am not the Yale Professor of the same name and I am unable to contribute to your volume on legal ethics. </b> </p>

        <h2> If you are not at the table, you are on the menu </h2>

        <p>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like<br>
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you<br>
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet<br>
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
